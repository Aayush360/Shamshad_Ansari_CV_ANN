# here we have looked at various techniques of image processing used to build computer vision

resizing :

aspect_ratio = width/height

while resizing, maintaining the original aspect ratio ensures that the resized image do not look
stretched or compressed


while performing addition operations, the pixel value may fall out of range
there are two methods for handling this situation:
1. saturated operation/ trimming: 250+ 10 : 255 ( done by CV)
2. modulo operation: (230+10)%256 : 4 (done by numpy)

# we can use both cv and numpy to handle the arithmetic operation
# which one to use depends upon situation and needs

# we have looked at masking, noise reduction, binarization, edge detection and contour detection
# using opencv functions

# techniques we have studied here are used for feature extraction and engineering for machine learning
